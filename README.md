This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Descripion
- This is a REST API using Next.js with TypeScript
    - It integrates with an external catfact API at https://catfact.ninja/
    - This API gets data from https://catfact.ninja/facts and provides it on Localhost:3000/api/...
    - It uses API routes of Next.js

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

    - Get **multiple** cat facts at `/api/facts`
    - Get **individual** cat facts by ID at `/api/fact/15`

  - For pagination:
    - `page=1`
    - `per_page=10`
  - For sorting:

    - `sort=reverse_alphabetic`
    - `sort=length_ascending`
    - `sort=length_descending`
  - For filtering by length:
    - `length_filter=60`

### Examples:
  - **All** available cat facts unsorted at `/api/facts`
  - **All** available cat facts in **alphabetic order** at `/api/facts?sort=alphabetic`
  - **All** available cat facts **sorted by length ascending** at `/api/facts?sort=length_ascending`
  - Cat facts **paginated** at `/api/facts?page=3&per_page=20`
  - Cat facts paginated and **sorted alphabetically** at `/api/facts?page=3&per_page=20&sort=alphabetic`
  - Cat facts paginated and **sorted by length ascending** at `/api/facts?page=3&per_page=20&sort=length_ascending`
  - Cat facts paginated and in **reverse alphabetic order** at `/api/facts?page=3&per_page=20&sort=reverse_alphabetic`
